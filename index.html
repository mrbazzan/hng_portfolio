            <p>Hello! My name is Bazzan, and I'm a Software Developer. I develop
                back-end web applications and API with Python(Django and Flask).
                I enjoy reading novels, playing chess and sports(American Football and Basketball).
                I also really enjoy contributing to open source projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                As someone who has treaded the waters of backend development
                for some time now, I would like to use the HNG platform as a spring
                to continue learning frontend development to complement my backend skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the next two years, it would be nice to revisit some frontend
                technologies that I have learnt in the past such as JQuery, CSS & some
                of its offspring; learn new technology such as React.

                Ultimately, I would love to build web applications that have real purposes
                i.e application that can be used in the real-world to solve problems and create value.

                Alongside that, another goal is to have gotten better as a developer by
                reading books such as:

                <ul>
                    <li>Software Design by Examples in Python</li>
                    <li>SICP</li>
                    <li>Architecture of Open Source Application (<a href="https://aosabook.org/en/">AOSA</a>)</li>
                    <li>Eloquent Javascript</li>
                    <li>Software Design by Examples in Javascript</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Contribute more to open source projects especially projects like Django.
                It would also be nice to get a job contributing to open source projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                It would also be nice to have utilized tech to solve a problem in Nigeria
                especially in the power and transportation sector.
